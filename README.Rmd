The `wnblr` package contains a range of game statistics from the Australian [**Women's National Basketball League (WNBL)**](https://www.wnbl.com.au):

- `box_scores`: Team-level box scores, with all your usual basketball box score metrics like points scored, field goals made / attempted, free throws made / attempted, rebounds, turnovers, and the like.
- `box_scores_detailed`: Player-level box scores.
- `pbp`: Play-by-play data.
- `shots`: Shots data, primarily containing XY shot locations.

## Installation

Install the development version of `wnblr` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jacquietran/wnblr")
```
## Examples

There's lots to work with - for example, here's a quick look at the `shots` data:

```{r shots, dpi=320, message = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(wnblr)
library(dplyr)

# Summarise frequency of different shot types
shots %>%
  filter(season == 2020) %>%
  select(sub_type, shot_result) %>%
  group_by(sub_type) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```

```{r plot}

# yellow = #FFC53D
# green = #0E4735

```

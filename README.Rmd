The `wnblr` package provides access to a range of game statistics from the Australian [**Women's National Basketball League (WNBL)**](https://www.wnbl.com.au):

- `load_box_scores()`: Team-level box scores, with all your usual basketball box score metrics like points scored, field goals made / attempted, free throws made / attempted, rebounds, turnovers, and the like.
- `box_scores_detailed`: Player-level box scores.
- `pbp`: Play-by-play data.
- `shots`: Shots data, primarily containing XY shot locations.

`r emo::ji("exclamation")``r emo::ji("exclamation")` Please note: The data currently contained in wnblr is largely provided "as scraped". This package is currently in alpha and needs data quality checks, so if you spot some strange numbers or want to help with checking for data bugs, feel free to log an issue - contributions welcome! `r emo::ji("exclamation")``r emo::ji("exclamation")` 

## Installation

Install the development version of `wnblr` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jacquietran/wnblr")
```
## Examples

There's lots to work with - for example, here's a quick look at the `shots` data:

```{r summarise_shots, message = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(wnblr)
library(dplyr)

# Frequency of shot types attempted in the 2020 season
shots %>%
  filter(season == 2020) %>%
  select(sub_type, shot_result) %>%
  group_by(sub_type) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```

With a little bit of elbow grease, you can move neatly from data to plot, too:

```{r plot, dpi=320, message = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(showtext)

# Tidy data
magbegor <- box_scores_detailed %>%
  filter(scoreboard_name == "E. Magbegor") %>%
  select(season, contains("field_goals")) %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(
    `Field goals made` = round(mean(field_goals_made), 1),
    `Field goals attempted` = round(mean(field_goals_attempted), 1),
    `Field goal %` = round(mean(field_goals_percentage), 1)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`Field goals made`,
             `Field goals attempted`,
             `Field goal %`),
    names_to = "key",
    values_to = "value") %>%
  mutate(
    key = factor(
      key, levels = c("Field goals made",
                      "Field goals attempted",
                      "Field goal %")))

# Import Google Fonts
font_add_google(name = "Patua One", family = "patua")
font_add_google(name = "Source Sans Pro", family = "source")

# Build plot
showtext_auto()
# After building the plot, run showtext_auto(FALSE) to close off
ggplot(
  magbegor,
  aes(x = season, y = value, group = key, fill = key)) +
  facet_wrap(~key, nrow = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FFC53D", "#688d3a", "#0E4735")) +
  labs(
    title = "Ezi Magbegor: WNBL shooting averages from 2017-2020",
    x = "Season", y = NULL,
    caption = "Data source: {wnblr} & WNBL.com.au | Plot: @jacquietran") +
  ggdark::dark_mode() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    text = element_text(
      colour = "#FFFFFF", family = "source", size = 48),
    plot.title = element_text(
      family = "patua", margin=margin(0,0,15,0)),
    plot.caption = element_text(margin=margin(15,0,0,0)))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

showtext_auto(FALSE)

```

## Known issues

Game data is missing or wildly incomplete for some games in most of the seasons from 2014/2015 to 2020, as documented [here](https://github.com/jacquietran/wnblr/issues/23). If anyone has leads on where to find live stats from the games listed as "missing", feel free to log an issue and let me know!
